# About me
My name is Piotr Rębisz. I am a Master of Finance and Accounting. I graduated from the Maria Curie-Skłodowska University in Lublin. I have been testing software for a year. My goal is to develop knowledge and technical skills in the field of testing. On this page, I would like to share all my experience gained in my current job.
